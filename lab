WRITING A HELM CHART: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Inspect the apiVersion set on this chart and identify what Helm version this chart was built for.

                Easier way to get this is use template. 

                helm template ./chart-name 

    4. Create a helm chart at /root/webapp-nginx for this application by converting the deployment and service definition files into templates.Create a chart first and then move the definition files into the templates directory.The deployment and service objects should be named in the format RELEASE-NAME-nginx.Set apiVersion for the chart to v2.Name the chart webapp-nginx.Set version number to 0.1.1.Set appVersion to 1.16.0.Values file has a variable image set by default so make changes for an image nginx:1.16.0.
