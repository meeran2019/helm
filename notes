What is HELM?:

        Helm is a package manager for kubernetes. 
        In templates, it contains all objects require for the projects and manage as package. 
        Without kubernetes, it requires to install and delete all objects like pods, deployment, services etc separately which cause operational overhead when project is complex. 

        Also can keep all objects in single file but still it is complex to manage and debug.
