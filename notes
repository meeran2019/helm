What is HELM?:

        Helm is a package manager for kubernetes. 
        In templates, it contains all objects require for the projects and manage as package. 
        Without kubernetes, it requires to install and delete all objects like pods, deployment, services etc separately which cause operational overhead when project is complex. 

        Also can keep all objects in single file but still it is complex to manage and debug.


Installing and Configuration:     

        https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/


Helm Components: 

        Charts              -   collection of objects. Contains instruction for helm needed.
        Release             -   Release chart to kubernetes. Each release can have multiple revision.
        metadata            -   saves in kubernetes itself as secrets.
        template            -   it is folder which contains all the kubernetes yaml files. 
        values.yaml         -   it contains the variable which applied in template.

    Release is used because multiple release can run using same chart. 

    Helm repositories is provided by different provider like bitnami etc. Artifcathub.io contains all repositories. 


Helm Charts: 

        It contains instructions to run.

        chart.yaml
        values.yaml 
        template 

Chart.yaml: 

        apiVersion      -   v1 for helm2 , v2 for helm3.
        appVersion      -   version of application
        version         -   version of chart itself. 
        name            -   name of chart 
        type            -   library & application.
        dependencies    -   can include other charts. 
        keywords        -   
        mainteners      -   email & name.

        chart.yaml
        templates
        values.yaml 
        charts          -   directory contain other charts. 


Working with Helm - Basics: 

        helm --help                 -   shares command details.
        helm search hub name        -   to search in artifact hub.
        helm search repo repo-name  -   to search in specific repository.

        helm repo add bitnami https:path    -   add bitnami repo to local.
        helm install release-name chart     -   to install chart. 

        helm list                   -   list all releases.
        helm uninstall release      -   to uninstall release.


Customize Chart Parameters:        

    At CLI: 

        helm install --set key1=value1 release-name chart-name          -> This override in values.yaml 

    Own Custom values.yml: 

            custom-values.yml: 

        helm install --values=custom-values.yml release-name chart-name 

    Update directly in values.yaml: 

        helm pull chart-name            -   pull in archived form.
        helm pull --untar chart-name    -   pull in unarchived form.
        helm install release-name ./chart-name      -   While run, refer the local directory path. 


Life cycle management with Helm: 

    helm upgrade release-name               -   to upgrade release to latest version. 
    helm history release-name               -   gives history of releases
    helm rollback release-name revision     -   It creates revision3 and revert the value of revision1.

    NOTE: Persistent volume / data will not have any change during rollback or upgrade.

WRITING A HELM CHART: 

        {{ }}                   -       Template directive 
        {{ .Release.Name }}     -       . represemt root level scope. 
        Release.Name            -       Release name. 

2nd part name is always capital because these are builtin objects. 

        Release.Name 
        Release.Namespace 
        Release.Revison 

        Chart.Name
        Chart.ApiVersion
        Chart.Version
        Chart.Type 

        Capabilities.APiVersions
        Capabilities.KubeVersion
        Capabilities.GitCommit 

        Values.key1
        Values.key2 


VERIFYING HELM CHART: 

        LINT: 
                Verify chart and yaml format is working correct. 
                helm lint ./chart 

        TEMPLATE:
                It renders the template locally and displays output. 
                helm template ./chart 
                helm template release-name ./chart 
                helm template ./chart --debug   

        DRY RUN: 
                Some errors can only be catch by kubernetes. 
                helm install release-name chart-name --dry-run
